### About this repo

This is a repo that was created during the first hackaton.
From the list of given tasks at least one task (of my choice) had to be implemented, described and delivered.

**List of tasks:**

- Hangman ---> (chosen task)
- Address book
- RPG Warrior's name generator
- RPG History (driven by user's choice)
- Card game (war)
- Quiz
- Tic tac toe game

### Introduction

Hangman is a guessing game for two or more players. One player thinks of a word, phrase or sentence and the other(s) tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses. Originally a Paper-and-pencil game, there are now electronic versions.

This is an implementation of this game, a console application version.
Computer has thought a word. At the beginning of the program, only the hidden word length is given to the user. User has to guess the computer's hidden word by providing single letters (one at a time, in a specific number of attemps) or the whole word at once.

The number of attempts for user to guess (either a single letter or the whole word) equals the length of computer's hidden word to guess. Seems fair, right?

### Project status

Implementation finished. Will not be further developed or supported.

### Technologies

The program is implemented in pure Python. No complications.

### Solution concept

In the implementation following were used:

- if statements and for loops
- lists
- string methods
- formatted string literal (f-string)

### Requirements

To run the program you only need to install Python 3 (any version). You can get Python from the following: http://python.org/download/. Simply download the Python installer and follow the instructions.

### Run the program

Open a command-line and type in the word 'python3', followed by the path to your script, just like this: <br>
>$ python3 hangman.py

If everything works okay, after you press 'Enter', you'll be provided with the short info needed to start the game and then asked to give an input.

### Usage

User can type correctly:

- single letter (alphabet):
<br>If user guess is right, then all the guessed letters are shown after every attempt.


- word(s):
<br>If user guess is right, then user wins and the program will end.


- 'exit' (to quit the program):
<br>The program will quit with exit code 0.
